==========

Why?
----
Developers don't always have access to backend servers to test on. What do web developers always have access to though? Chrome. By making a testing backend for Chrome, this takes away the limitation of being at a dedicated development machine. With access to your code and Chrome, this library gives you the ability to prototype on any computer or os (Including ChromeOS).

Influences
----------
Sinatra, Express and Martini are the models this framework tries to emulate. The goal of this project is to make this framework easy enough to switch out for any of these(though express will obviously be the easiest).

How?
----
In short, [Socket Api](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/socket.html).
